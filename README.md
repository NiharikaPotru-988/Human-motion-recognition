# Human Motion Recognition System

## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a **Human Motion Recognition System**, designed to classify and analyze human movements using machine learning techniques. The system is capable of processing motion data and identifying various actions such as walking, running, and jumping with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Motion Data Pre-processing**: Cleans and normalizes raw motion data for analysis.
- **Action Classification**: Classifies human actions such as walking, running, jumping, etc.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements advanced algorithms for accurate motion recognition.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing motion patterns and classification results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - `NumPy` and `Pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `Scikit-Learn` and `TensorFlow` for implementing machine learning models.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Tools**:
  - Motion data collection using accelerometers or public datasets.
  - Jupyter Notebook for model training and testing.

## Key Achievements
- Achieved high accuracy in human motion classification across multiple activities.
- Developed scalable and efficient algorithms for real-time motion recognition.
- Visualized key motion patterns for better interpretability of the results.
